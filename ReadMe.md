# Bitcoin Global Education Fund

Pay people to learn about Bitcoin.

## Mission

Spread monetary freedom by increasing global Bitcoin Network adoption through education and Bitcoin seeding in economically vulnerable regions.

## Strategy

Establish a grant funded via monthly donations from members of the Bitcoin community. With those funds, pay persons in economically vulnerable regions to complete an open source, Bitcoin-only course that concludes with setting up a mobile lightning wallet and receiving sats. 

## Case Study

Bitcoin Beach was successful because two critical components were merged.
- Bitcoin was seeded in El Zonte giving community members Bitcoin to spend without requiring them to buy it through an exchange. These sats were gifted to El Zonte by an anonymous donor.
- There was a dedicated team of educators on the ground in El Zonte.

## Benefits of Seeding Bitcoin

- Embeds Bitcoin directly into the local economy. This is critical.
- Incentivizes learning and participation in the Bitcoin network.
- Removes the need to register a newbie to a “crypto” exchange.
- Does not expose a newbie to the “crypto” casino.
- Removes the need to convince a learner to trade highly valued fiat they might not have for something they no little to nothing about.

## Benefits of Hands-On Bitcoin Education

- Spreading global monetary freedom through education and hands-on use of Bitcoin over the Lightning Network.
- Develop cursory awareness of the role monetary policy plays in the economic health of nations.
- Steal recipients against “crypto” scams.
- Asymmetrical currency arbitrage. Relatively small sums of USD or EUR could incentivize the onboarding of a significant number of people in regions where the local currency is comparatively weak. 
  - For example, France’s “monetary colonialism” as Gladstein calls it, becomes its greatest disadvantage. As in the classic example of Blockbuster Video, the improved distribution of the Bitcoin network circumvents and undermines France’s insidious dampening of the economic prosperity of CFA nations (https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization).

## Benefits to NGO’s

- In order to establish an organized network of educators, we would seek the assistance of the Human Rights Foundation with whom the Bitcoin community has an existing positive relationship.
- Explore the creation and management of a non-intermediary, donor-to-recipient distribution system. 
- The possibility of establishing a platform for such NGO’s using this initiative as a model.


## Benefits of the Initiative to the Bitcoin Community

- Increased adoption and usage of Bitcoin.
- Development of proof of concept features that run on the Bitcoin network.

### Proof of Concept Features of the Initiative

- Identity
  - Bitcoin based decentralized identity (DID) is used for all participants
 - Smart Contracts
   - Payments are peer to peer, e.g., made from the donor directly to the recipient.  
   - These funds are unlocked by the course instructor upon completion of the course. 
   - Graduates of the Bitcoin course receive a bonus for referring a friend who also completes the course. 
- Proof of Certification
  - Each graduate of the Bitcoin Course receives a certification associated with their decentralized identity.
- Relationships
  - A record of donor/recipient relationships is maintained on the network and displayed on the official website.
- Financial Services
  - Subscription service that converts fiat to BTC and readies it for distribution to recipients over the Lightning Network.

- Risks
  - As usual, the risk is scammers. Spoofing, phishing, etc. online and any manner of on the ground abuses or extortions. Each on the ground educational organization would need to be very well managed, providing space, training and managing educators, preventing duplicates, ensuring safety, and much more. 
  - How scalable is it?
  - Funding is tough. OSS software with HRF management? Fully funded until converted into a DAO?
  - Are these software feature goals technically possible on the Bitcoin network today?
